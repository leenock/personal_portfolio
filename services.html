                                    I offer customised SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) to ensure your website is rising the ranks in Google and staying at the top.
                                </p> 
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Review your current website to determine what sections are doing well, what improvements can be made, and to identify any areas that could be causing problems.
                                </p>  
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    After reviewing your website, there is a need to prepare the WordPress admin for the SEO content that you will add. An SEO plugin will be added directly into your website’s WordPress admin area, thus allowing you to add in meta descriptions, titles, and meta keywords. I also tidy up your website’s URLs and permalinks, and ensure that all images follow a strict keyword-full naming convention.
                                </p>  
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    I’ll set up a Google Analytics account and from there you’ll be able to monitor your website’s performance, including where your website visitors come from, whether they are using a desktop computer, tablet, or mobile device, the keywords they have used to find your website, the number of visitors your website has had, and much more.
                                <br>
                                A blog can play an important role in SEO if updated regularly. Your keyword-rich content doesn’t have to stop on your website’s pages. Having enticing blog posts that contain your keywords will constantly improve your SEO. Blog posts can be automatically added to your Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus pages so that all of your web presences are up-to-date.
                                <br>
                                Having a professional website that your customers can trust is essential, and creating a Google Places account will only strengthen your brand. A Google Places account will also allow your website to stand out on a Google search and to show your business location on Google Maps.
                                </p>  
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Having a social media presence is vital for a website in order to stay current and provide the information that your visitors will expect. A social plugin will be added directly into your website’s WordPress admin area. This will add share and like buttons to all of the content on your website. Shared content will link back to your website and increase your website’s popularity. You’ll also be able to add links to your social accounts so that your visitors can keep up-to-date on your current news.

                            </div>
                            <div class="article-content">
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Simplicity is one of the golden rules of website design. The audience should have an enjoyable,
                                     positive experience when using your website. Whether their objective is reading content, watching a 
                                     video or enrolling in a course, every action should be clear and concise throughout the website. My approach is to create a 
                                    website that strengthens your company’s or business brand while ensuring ease of use and simplicity for your audience.
                                </p>   

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    The website design process begins with sketching page layouts, wireframes, sitemaps, and menu structures on paper.
                                     Digital design concepts are then created, incorporating your company’s brand guidelines for a personalised look and feel.
                                      You will be presented with a variety of website design concepts to review. Feedback on the design ideas is
                                       important because it gives you a chance
                                     to say what you think about the design and make changes if you want to before the final sign-off. 
                                </p> 
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    Once the design has been finalised, the creation of the website or custom WordPress theme can begin. 
                                    The website development process starts by taking the graphical elements (colours, fonts, layout, images)
                                     defined in the design process and coding them using web industry standards (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS, and jQuery). 
                                     This is typically done by first coding the home page, followed by templates for the interior pages. 
                                     When the website is ready for review, you will be supplied with login details to view the website before it 
                                     is launched to the public. You will also be supplied with instructions on how to update your website.

                                <h6>WordPress CMS (Content Management System)</h6>
                                The WordPress CMS adds a user-friendly administrative area to your website, allowing you to easily login and update the content of your website at any time. You can effortlessly make textual, graphic, or structural changes to the website in an instant without having to deal with or look at any of the complicated programming code. You will have full control over your website’s content.
                                <h6>Custom WordPress Theme</h6>
                                Custom WordPress theme creation begins with creating a unique design. This process begins with sketching page layouts, wireframes, sitemaps, and menu structures on paper. You will be presented with a variety of website design concepts to review. Feedback on the design concepts is essential to give you the opportunity to express your thoughts on the design and make alterations where desired before the final sign-off. Once the design has been finalised, the creation of the custom WordPress theme can begin. This starts by taking the graphical elements (colours, fonts, layout, images) defined in the design process and coding them using web industry standards (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JS, jQuery). This is typically done by first coding the home page, followed by templates for the interior pages. When the website is ready for review, you will be supplied with login details to view the website before it is launched to the public. You will also be supplied with instructions on how to update your website.
                                <h6>Pre-Purchased WordPress Themes</h6>
                                A pre-purchased WordPress theme is perfect for websites on a tight budget or deadline. It is an out-of-the-box design and layout that is ready to integrate into the WordPress CMS straight away. WordPress handles all of the content for you (posts, pages, comments, etc.), while the theme transforms that content into a beautiful and clean layout for your audience to view. You can make small changes to the design to match your company's brand, such as changing the colors, adding a logo, and adding images, but if you want a unique, custom design, you should choose a custom Wordpress theme.
                                <h6>WordPress Training</h6>
                                With my past experience and skills on custom WordPress sites, I offer customised WordPress training to ensure you and your team can effectively manage your website through the WordPress administrative area.
